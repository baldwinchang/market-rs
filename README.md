# market-rs, a demo real-time service

market-rs is a personal pet project to learn a new programming language.

In theory, building a toy market system can be a wonderful way to learn a new technical stack and demonstrate proficiency. Join me on my journey to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

# Why a market?

A market demonstrates the interaction between several systems that are critical to becoming proficient in learning an end-to-end toolchain including programming language, interface design, networking, and information retrieval.

The abstract concepts include:
1. Transactional value store (wallet, bank, transfers)
1. Securitization of abstract assets (listings)
1. Real-time auction of securities (bid, asks, matching)

The backing technologies include:
1. Programming language(s)
1. Databases
1. Networking
1. User interface
1. System integration design

With principles such as:
1. Simple
2. Performant
3. Maintainable
